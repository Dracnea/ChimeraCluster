# Installation Guide for OpenMP Based Software

## What is OpenMP?

OpenMP is a group of softwares used within computer clusters or other groups of computers to pass messages between each node (computer) to allow for the full cluster to run a given piece of code or application. There are different versions of OpenMP based on what languages you plan to have the clustered computer running. These different softwares can be run side by side in order to allow for a variety of programming langauges to be used over the clusters combined computing power.

## Prerequisites

The following should be done before performing any installations:

First make sure that all current apt's are up to date in order to grab the most recent versions for compilers and openMP software.
THIS MAY BREAK RPI4 AS IT HAS LITTLE OS / BOOT FILE SUPPORT AS OF 8/26/19.

`sudo apt-get update` <br />
`sudo apt-get upgrade` <br />
`sudo reboot` <br />

Ensure that you have Make installed.

`sudo apt-get install make` <br />

Ensure that gcc, g++ and gfortran are all installed for C, C++ and Fortran compiler support. Most systems should at least initially have gcc.

`sudo apt-get install gcc` <br />
`sudo apt-get install g++` <br />
`sudo apt-get install gfortran` <br />

Check to see if any openMP related software is already installed and what version it currently is.

For C/C++/Fortran <br />
`sudo openmpi-bin_info` <br />
For Python <br />
`sudo python-mpi4py_info` <br />

## Basic Installation

The Basic Installation is the simpliest and recommended way to add openMP software to your device. This will grab the latest build that is stable based on your OS and Processor type. This may mean that your installed version will not be the latest OpenMP version but this is fine.

#### Installation of OpenMPI:
For C/C++/Fortran <br />
`sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin` <br />

#### Installation of MPI4PY:
For Python <br />
`sudo apt-get install python-mpi4py` <br />

## Basic Testing

Once all OpenMP software has been installed it can be tested using the command mpiexec. Here are some examples:

With a Compiled C Program <br />
`mpiexec ./helloWorld`<br />

With a Python Script <br />
`mpiexec python test.py`<br />

## Advanced Installation

You may also choose to locally build and install a more recent version of any of the OpenMP software. It is not recommended that you replace any current versions of OpenMP installed using the Command Line or that came prepackaged with your OS as they may be vital or are the most recent stable version based on your OS and Processor. Locally building newer versions of OpenMP software may work on your computer but, even if they fully work, please keep in mind that they are not considered stable or supported.

#### Initial Setup

Before you begin you will want to create the following directories: <br />
`sudo mkdir /usr/local/openMPI` <br />
`sudo mkdir /usr/local/openMPI-dl` <br />
`sudo mkdir /usr/local/openMPI-build` <br />

#### Local OpenMPI Installation

Begin by moving to your openMPI download folder: <br />
`cd /usr/local/openMPI-dl` <br />

Download the most recent version of OpenMPI: (This example shows Version 4.0.1) <br />
`sudo wget https://download.open-mpi.org/release/open-mpi/v4.0/openmpi-4.0.1.tar.gz`<br />

Extract the file from the tar.gz: <br />
`sudo tar zxcf openmpi-4.0.1.tar.gz` <br />

Move to your build folder: <br />
`cd /usr/local/openMPI-build` <br />

Run the Configuration Process: (This will take some time.) <br />
`sudo /usr/local/openMPI-dl/openmpi-4.0/configure â€“prefix=/usr/local/openMPI` <br />

Make the build: (This will take a very long time.) <br />
`sudo make` <br />

Install the build: <br />
`sudo make all install`

#### Local Version Testing

Now you will want to test the locally installed version of OpenMPI. 
Run the following command: <br />
`/usr/local/openMPI/bin/mpiexec -n 1 date` <br />
So long as this returns the date once than this local version of mpi is installed.
